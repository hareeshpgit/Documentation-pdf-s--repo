2nd- method ---
Take server and node two instances 

1-  ssh-keygen --server
    ls -la
    cd .ssh
2- ssh-keygen --node 
   ls -la 
   cd .ssh 
   --> cat id_pub.rsa --copy and paste in node machine authorized keys at the top) we can copy in any nodes then only main n-server can establish the communication.

3- install ansible related packages 

-- sudo amazon-linux-extras enable ansible2 -y --- linux2 ami
-- yum install ansible -y --

in-server
hostnamectl set-hostname ans-server
    2  exec bash
    3  ssh-keygen
    4  ls -la
    5  cd .ssh
    6  ls
    7  cat authorized_keys 
    8  cat id_rsa.pub 
    9  cd
   10  ssh 172.31.22.29
   11  ls
   12  ls -la
   13  cd .ssh/
   14  ls
   15  cd
   16  sudo amazon-linux-extras enable ansible2 -y
   17  sudo yum install -y ansible -y
   18  ansible --version
   19  python --version
   
     cd /etc/ansible/
     ls
     vi hosts 
     ansible all -m ping 
     ansible all --list-hosts
